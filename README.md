## What?
This is a website that makes phrases like the infamous misquoted "[Now I am become death, destroyer of worlds](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Now_I_am_become_Death,_the_destroyer_of_worlds)". There are toggles in the bottom to make the quotes more rude/offensive. They wont' always make sense but they might sometimes be funny.


### What counts as lewd?

Lewd is for things that are either sexual or offensive. "Queer", for example, is neither of those but "fucker" is.


## Development
If you want to add new words to the library then all you need to do is edit [strings.json](source/strings.json). 

If you want to mess with the rest of the site you need to do `pnpm i` and then `pnpm run dev` to start a live reload server.
